// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analyisOfRequirements = "The second step, usually a senior member (or members) of a development team collaborates with the customer on what the requirements are for the software. The outcome of this stage is to define the various technical approaches that can be used for the project successfully with the least amount of risk."
const design = "This step of software development takes the requirements and turns them into a detailed system of specifications for how the project should look. The design must be approved before moving forward."
const implementation = "The process of configuring software for use, and possibly training people (customers or clients) to use the software."
const testingAndIntegration = "System testing of software begins at this phase. Any pieces of the project that are separate are combined at this point into a working project and are tested by the development team. Usually the project has to pass a 'test readiness review' before it gets the green light to go live from an IT team."
const maintain = "The final step. Ensures quality of the software and its life cycle by making updates as needed so the software functions perfectly."
